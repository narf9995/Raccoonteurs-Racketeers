This is a play-test prototype of the game.
Being the very first semi-official written ruleset for the game, it will likely have some errors and flaws.
I will address those as they come up in play and update the rules accordingly.
I have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/ypxHt6C) were I will be running games where people are welcome to join my friends and I, but I also encourage you to start your own games.
I want to build as much diversity in ideas as possible.
Heck even if you don't like raccoons, but you just like the mechanics, please feel free to fork it and let me know what awesome things you create!

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub; the Ruleset, Grandkit (GM) Info, and Raccoontuer Generation Resources are all available in the list of links above this Read Me.
There are .pdf versions available, although the formatting leaves something to be desired.
